# Terraform AWS Config blueprint

Blueprint to create a minimal and secure AWS Config configuration. By default a
encrypted secure bucket is created and the Config is set to use it to store
configuration snapshots. AWS Config does not support KMS in the current moment
this blueprint was created so it uses the SSE with AES256 auto managed key to
encrypt snapshots. It also creates a config recorder per region to avoid left
an unmonitored region and aggregates rules compliance on the main region.

## Usage

You can use this module through the example bellow:

```terraform
module "name" {
  source = "github.com/pro-terraform-blueprints/terraform-aws-config-blueprint?ref=<VERSION>"

  name = "..."
  description = "..."
}
```

Where `<VERSION>` is the tag version you want to use. I do not recomend using
the branch as the source, verify the available tags and specify a given version,
this will avoid that breaking changes spread to your modules without warning.
See more details on **Versions** session on main [organization documentation](https://github.com/pro-terraform-blueprints/terraform-blueprints-documentation):

This module accepts others parameters, see the **Input** session bellow.

## Architecture

AWS Config have two parts, the first one is the inventory of cloud resources
with frequent snapshots of each component (on a log bucket) and Config Rules to
check the account and region compliance with a given regulatory item. This
blueprint can take care of both and provides some helpers on cross account
snapshots and rules aggregations.

### Log bucket

As stated, the blueprint creates an bucket on the main region (the default one
you configure on Terraform and AWS credentials) by default with security options
enabled. It is versioned, encrypted with AES256, have default policies to ensure
upload snapshots will use this encryption and only allow AWS Config to store
things there.

You can customize the bucket name using the `bucket\_prefix` and
`bucket\_suffix` (pay attention on the `name\_separator` too and the main
documentation from Pro Terraform Templates) in combination with the `name`
parameter. Remember your bucket name must be unique across entire world.

The deliver frequency is configured by the `delivery\_frequency` parameter that
defaults to `TwentyFour_Hours` value. You can change it to deliver it more
often (will cost more since more snapshots will be delivery and consume more
space on bucket). You can see the inventory history from Config API for one year
(365 days) and can change that setting the `retention\_period\_in\_days`
input parameter to how many days it will stay accessible.

#### Bucket policies

By default the bucket has the same bucket policy from the
[Log bucket blueprint](https://github.com/pro-terraform-blueprints/terraform-aws-log-bucket-blueprint)
using AES256 encryption. Refer to it documentation for details.

Bucket policies can be customized setting the `extra\_bucket\_policy\_statements`.

#### Snapshots expiration and transitions

A important part of security regulatory compliances is to store logs in a
determined time window and the AWS Config snapshots are very important piece of
evidence analisys for security on AWS accounts, so by default the blueprint
set some values in compliance with the PCI DSS 3.2.1 to store the referred logs
on for one year being the first 90 days easilly recoverable from the log bucket.
Note that Config already stores the history for 90 days, but you need to
allow access directly to the CloudTrail API. S3 API is simplier to access and
the bucket policies provides a extra access layer to ensure security. Also S3
allow event handling and integration with AWS Athena to search for specific
events directly.

You can edit the expiration of the snapshots on bucket setting the
`bucket\_logs\_expiration` parameter. Logs can become very expensive if stored
for a long time, by default the blueprint stores the logs for one year after the
creation of a specific file on the bucket, change it only if you have a internal
or external regulatory demanding more time.

To make the Config storing less expensive (usually trails generates consumes very
few space, but are exceptions) the blueprint have transitions to more cheap
storage options on the S3 log bucket after a time. By default after 30 days they
move a given log to the `Standard Infrequent Access` area, and after 90 days to
the `Glacier` service. You can change this setting the
`bucket\_logs\_transitions` parameter, wich is a list of values for a parameter
inside the transition object of the Terraform bucket resource. The default value
is set like this:

```
[
  {
    days          = 30
    storage_class = "STANDARD_IA"
  },
  {
    days          = 90
    storage_class = "GLACIER"
  },
]
```

That is not recommended using the `ONEZONE_IA` storage class since snapshots must
have as much durability as possible (surelly you don't want lost a file which
will give you a security evidence). Also be aware some regions does not have
Glacier support (like sa,east-1, SÃ£o Paulo) and you will be forced to override
this default to net get an error.

#### Custom bucket

If you already have an bucket because it was created manually or in another
Terraform module, you can use it setting `auto\_create\_bucket` to `false` and
pointing `custom\_bucket\_name` to the giving bucket. The blueprint already take
care of the IAM policy to allow the AWS Config to write things on the bucket,
if the is in another account then you need to write a policy allowing the Config
from another account to write on it.

### IAM role

#### Custom role

### Inventory and rules on extra regions

#### Activating AWS managed rules per region

#### Aggregations

### Cross account snapshots and aggregations
